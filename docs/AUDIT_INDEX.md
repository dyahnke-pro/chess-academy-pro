# Audit Index

Single manifest for every UI/surface audit in the app. New audits add a
row here when they ship. Open audits get a status flag so parallel
sessions don't double-drive the same surface.

The pattern across audits is consistent:
- **UX contract** doc — what the surface MUST do, hand-written contract
- **Audit script** — Playwright drive against the deployed app
  (`scripts/audit-<surface>.mjs`), green or fail per surface
- **E2E spec** — Vitest/Playwright spec under `e2e/` for build-time
  regression
- **Audit reports** — `audit-reports/<surface>-<iso>/` (gitignored,
  generated per run)

Status legend: ✅ shipped · 🟡 partial · 🚧 in flight (another session) ·
❌ untouched · — N/A on this surface.

## How to add a new audit

1. **Read the surface end-to-end.** No skimming. Cite line numbers.
2. **Write a UX contract doc** — `docs/<surface>-ux-contract.md`.
   Sections: `SHOULD WORK` (numbered contracts), `AUDIT COVERAGE`
   (what tests verify each contract).
3. **Write a Playwright drive script** —
   `scripts/audit-<surface>.mjs`, mirror
   [`audit-coach-review.mjs`](../scripts/audit-coach-review.mjs) /
   [`audit-coach-chat.mjs`](../scripts/audit-coach-chat.mjs). Single
   Chromium session, SPA nav via clicks, audit-stream POST intercept,
   per-surface `record()` with `expectations` array.
4. **Run against prod.** Identify failed expectations. Fix product
   bugs (don't just patch the test). Add build-time tests for
   data-shape regressions.
5. **Add an E2E spec** (`e2e/<surface>.spec.ts`) when the surface
   warrants Playwright-level CI coverage.
6. **Add `audit-reports/<surface>-*/` to `.gitignore`.**
7. **Add a row to the matrix above.** Status, links, date.
8. **Commit + push.** Vercel auto-deploys; if `git push` fails (PAT
   403), `vercel --prod` is the fallback.

## Audit philosophy (locked in)

- **Surface-mount-only checks are banned.** Every interactive
  affordance must do something visible; verify the visible outcome.
- **Animations: poll-until-stable, not fixed sleep.**
- **For multi-move flows: track WHOSE COLOR moved.**
- **Pull audit-stream events per scenario** to verify expected
  events fired (and unexpected events did not).
- **Sweep, don't spot-fix.** When a bug surfaces, grep the codebase
  for every other instance of the same pattern before declaring done.
- **BEST fix.** Wire dead things, scrap redundancies, don't ship
  cosmetic patches.
