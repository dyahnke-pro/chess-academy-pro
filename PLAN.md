# PLAN — closing the loop (2026-09-18)

## 2026-09-18 — end of night: the two owed post-deploy audits

Both run against the live bundle `index-7h-hez6i.js` (commit `cb2ef99b1`),
SEQUENTIALLY, nothing else on the box.

**LEARN — `audit-concept-gameplay-prod` 8/8 GREEN.** The rating change is
verified on the surface it could have broken. Real prose off the listener:
the coach named the opening aloud ("This game is now the Scandinavian
Defense"), then spoke the computed invariant mid-GAME — *"Careful — your
queen on d5 is attacked and nothing's defending it. There's a pin here for
you — have a look. Remember — a pin freezes the piece in front: it can't
move without exposing the more valuable piece behind it."* Correct seat,
correct board, concept voiced from the live computer rather than a bake.

**REVIEW — `audit-review-overhaul-prod`.** Every PRODUCT contract passed
across 54 narrated plies (board-accuracy, seat, no-trade-win, need
coverage 11/12 owed plies, exchange ledger, perspective). The two reds were
both the INSTRUMENT, and both are fixed:

- RECAP/FUNDLEAD concluded "the engine flagged NO student ply" from the
  WALK, and RECAP hardcoded "the seeded game has two" from the days this
  audit ran one fixture. It now rotates a fresh master game each run, so a
  GM draw with genuinely zero flagged plies red-failed a healthy product
  against a constant about a different game. Both now corroborate against
  the annotation record in Dexie (`[engine record] 0 flagged student
  ply(s)`), which took FUNDLEAD red → green on proof instead of
  self-declaration.
- HEAP printed "renderer heap exploded" on a run whose heap sat flat at
  350MB and whose only trip was the worker census. It now names which of
  its three trip causes fired.

**Two findings carried forward, not fixed tonight:**
- **#21** the pthread census is the multi-threaded SINGLETON, not the pool
  (which has been single-thread since 2026-09-07), and it is INTERMITTENT —
  70 workers in one run, 1 in the next on the same game.
- **#70** the review audit's verdict is not reproducible: three runs, three
  different red sets, because the background deep dive is a race the
  harness neither waits on nor reports. A verdict that changes run to run
  makes both colours meaningless.


## The one disease behind everything landed tonight

**A computer wired ONE WAY ONLY, with prose describing the half that is not
connected.** Every instance passed every gate, because no gate can check a
comment against its code. Three found in one session:

| computer | computed | consumed | why nobody noticed |
|---|---|---|---|
| opening announcement | 5× per game | **0×** | flag spent at QUEUE time, and the late queue was nulled on most turns |
| `capabilityEvidence` green | every reviewed game | **0 readers** | `getCapabilityProfile` had 3 call sites, all in its own test |
| coach-games K=32 ELO | every boot | **0** | only `imported-games` was applied; the rest waited on a picker deleted 2026-09-02 |

When you find a doc comment describing a system, GREP FOR ITS READER before you
trust it. That is the cheapest check in this repo and it found three defects.

## Landed (2026-09-18, all on `main`, ship-check green)

- [x] `7cecd3d5c` — **level II of context is generated + verified.**
      `scripts/state-of-build.mjs` derives the state from the code;
      `--verify` runs in ship-check and fails the push when `docs/STATE.md` is
      stale. Proven non-vacuous (mutate the file → exit 1).
- [x] `37daa3a25` — **opening name: queueing is not saying.** Split
      `announcedOpeningName` into `detectedOpeningName` (context, immediate) and
      `spokenOpeningName` (written only where a voice package kept an `opening`
      fact). `hasInstantTeaching` → `noteTaughtThisTurn` (`kind === 'note'`);
      it had been nulling the whole late queue on any substantive fact.
      Prod-verified: game 2 computed 5→10, **spoken 0→10**.
- [x] `cc501a2e0` — **the heat map can lower.** `capabilityTerm` in `needScore`
      is the first term that can reduce need. GREY (absent) and RED (any
      `broken`) lower nothing; GREEN (held ≥ 3, zero broken) goes quiet. The
      ply→tag join is COMPUTED by `capabilitiesShown` — the same computer that
      writes green — so no fourth fact-to-hole mapping was authored.
      `docs/STATE.md` moved 0 readers → 2.
- [x] `53b5189c6` — **the adaptive rating never adapted.** `calibrateStrength`
      re-estimates on every boot and applies any MEASURED source
      (`imported-games` or `coach-games`); guesses (`profile`, `default`) still
      write nothing. `needsPicker` deleted; `strengthCalibrated` bridged (still
      persisted for `DashboardPage`, no longer freezes re-estimation).

## Open, ranked — what still blocks the picture

1. **GREY still expires after 5 games** (task #65). The only thing speaking for
   unknown-ness is a GLOBAL prior gated on `gamesPlayed < COLD_START_GAMES`. After
   game 5 a capability never asked about earns no teaching — the ALGO rule's exact
   ban. Fixing it needs the prior to be PER-TAG, which needs `capabilityTags` on
   every `computeNeed` caller (today only `teachingSelector` supplies them;
   `positionFacts` and `coachFeatureService` pass none). Do NOT just make the prior
   permanent — that scores every ply 100, need never vetoes, and the coach talks on
   every student ply forever.
2. **The rating INPUT is still split** (`docs/STATE.md` MODEL). 39 files read
   `currentRating` off the store, 2 read the adaptive estimate, 63 inline `?? 1200`.
   The number is now correct at the source; threading it is the remaining half.
   CLAUDE.md: fix the INPUT before tuning any threshold.
3. **Corpus reach is ZERO on review and endgame** (`docs/STATE.md` SAY). Review is
   where the diagnosis happens.
4. **Two shared positions go silent in game 2** (task #68) — n=1 evidence; WIDEN
   THE SAMPLE before fixing.
5. `tsconfig.app.json` excludes every test file (task #61), so test type errors are
   invisible — this session shipped two test literals that only a runtime failure
   would have caught.

## Next-session pickup

1. Gain all four levels (CLAUDE.md → `docs/STATE.md` → `surface-map.mjs --changed` → the code).
2. Take open item 1 or 2 above.
3. Audits run SEQUENTIALLY and with NOTHING beside them — no typecheck, no vitest.
   A review run was invalidated twice this session by CPU stacked next to it.
