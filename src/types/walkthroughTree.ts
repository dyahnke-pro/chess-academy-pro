/**
 * WalkthroughTree — tree-shaped opening lesson with branch points.
 *
 * Distinct from `WalkthroughSession` (a flat ordered list of steps).
 * Openings are not linear — they have forks (e.g. the Vienna at move
 * 2 has three popular Black responses), and a real coach pauses at
 * each fork and asks the student which line to explore. The flat
 * Session shape can't represent that; this Tree shape can.
 *
 * Runtime: `useTeachWalkthrough` walks the tree node-by-node. When
 * `node.children.length > 1`, it pauses and renders tap targets;
 * when `=== 1`, it advances automatically; when `=== 0`, it's a
 * leaf — the coach delivers the leaf's outro and offers to back up
 * to the last fork or take the position into a real game.
 *
 * The data file declares MOVES only (SAN). FENs are computed at
 * runtime by walking chess.js through the move sequence — no
 * hand-written FENs to typo, no per-edit re-validation.
