/**
 * useAdaptiveDrillSession
 * -----------------------
 * Infinite-stream drill mode for endgame lessons. Each drill is
 * pulled from the Lichess puzzle DB at a target rating; after the
 * student completes a drill, the hook adjusts the target up or
 * down based on their performance (errors + time-to-solve), then
 * picks the next puzzle closest to the new target.
 *
 * Adjustment rules:
 *   - 0 errors,  < 30s  → +75  (step up sharply)
 *   - 0 errors,  < 60s  → +25  (step up gently)
 *   - ≤2 errors, < 120s → ±0   (hold target)
 *   - 3+ errors OR  ≥ 120s → −50  (step down)
 *
 * The target clamps to [600, 2400] so the student doesn't run off
 * the rating ladder in either direction. Excludes previously-
 * played puzzles within the session so the student doesn't repeat
 * the same drill until the pool exhausts.
 *
 * Persistence is intentionally NOT in this hook — the host can
 * pass `initialRating` from Dexie if a stored target exists; this
 * hook returns the live targetRating for the host to persist on
 * recordOutcome if it wants to.
