/**
 * useEndgamePlayout
 * -----------------
 * Multi-ply playout runner for endgame lessons. The student plays
 * each of their moves on the board; the opponent's curated reply
 * auto-plays after a brief animation delay. Wrong move flashes
 * red, the position stays, the student retries until they find
 * the move.
 *
 * Two flavours of "the answer":
 *   1. Curated `solution` (SAN[], alternating student/opponent
 *      starting with the student) — every move is hand-authored
 *      from named chess theory. This is the canonical path.
 *   2. Stockfish fallback — when the curated line ends OR is empty
 *      but a single `bestMove` is provided, the student plays their
 *      move and the engine plays the reply via getCoachMove(). Used
 *      by Eval Lab stage 2 ("play it out") to test whether the
 *      student can hold the eval through a real engine response.
 *
 * Architectural contract: this hook NEVER asks an LLM what to play.
 * Curated moves come from the lesson JSON; engine moves come from
 * Stockfish via coachPlaySession. The hook is pure runtime — no
 * authorship at runtime, per CLAUDE.md.
