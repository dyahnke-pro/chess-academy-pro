/**
 * useTeachWalkthrough
 * -------------------
 * Drives an in-place walkthrough of a `WalkthroughTree` on the
 * /coach/teach surface. Replaces the old "navigate to a separate
 * walkthrough page" flow that lost the chat panel.
 *
 * State machine (the `phase` field):
 *   - 'idle'      : nothing active; start(tree) to begin.
 *   - 'narrating' : board shows current node's FEN, voice speaks
 *                   `node.idea`. When voice resolves, transition to
 *                   one of: linear-advance (auto next), 'fork', 'leaf'.
 *   - 'fork'      : board paused at a branch point; tap targets shown.
 *                   pickFork(idx) → narrating(child).
 *   - 'leaf'      : board paused at the end of a chosen branch.
 *                   backtrackToLastFork() restores the last fork.
 *                   playItOut() handed back to caller via callback.
 *   - 'paused'    : user (or brain) interrupted mid-narration. Voice
 *                   stopped, board frozen at current FEN. resume()
 *                   re-narrates the same node's idea.
 *
 * The hook OWNS chess.js — it walks SANs from the root through the
 * current path to compute FEN. Exposes the FEN to the component so
 * the board renders the correct position. Caller does not provide
 * FENs in the data file.
 *
 * Voice integration: speaks `idea` via `voiceService.speakForced`,
 * with a backup timer that advances even if TTS hangs. Same pattern
 * `walkthroughRunner.runStep` uses; inlined here because the tree
 * runner has different transition logic.
