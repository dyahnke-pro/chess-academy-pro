  intro:
    "The Vienna Game. It's the King's Pawn opening's quieter, sharper cousin — quieter because we develop a knight before the bishop, sharper because we keep the f-pawn free for an attack. Most beginners learn the Italian or the Spanish; the Vienna is what you play when you want the same classical pressure but with a tactical engine humming under the hood. Let me walk you through it.",
  outro:
    "That's a typical position you'd see in this branch. Want to back up to the last decision and see the other line? Or take this position into a real game against me?",
  leafOutros: {
    // Vienna Gambit accepted main line — after 4.e5 every Black knight
    // square except Ng8 hangs material to the open d1-h5 diagonal. The
    // gambit is honestly bad for Black; we ship White's huge advantage.
    'e4 e5 Nc3 Nf6 f4 exf4 e5 Ng8 Nf3':
      "And there it is — the Vienna Gambit accepted, the truth of the line. Black's knight is buried back on g8, having spent two tempi for nothing. We have a huge lead in development, the open e-file, and the f4-pawn (Black's prize) is just a target waiting to be picked off. From here White's plan: Bc4 eyeing f7, castle, take f4 with the c1-bishop, then attack. Black is just worse — at master level the gambit accepted is considered theoretically bad for Black, which is why most strong Black players play the Falkbeer (3...d5) instead. Now you know why.",
    // Falkbeer Variation modern challenge — 5.Qf3 attacks the e4-knight
    // directly, forcing Black to commit on move five. Sharper than 5.Nf3
    // (the older calm move) and the line preferred by modern theory.
    'e4 e5 Nc3 Nf6 f4 d5 fxe5 Nxe4 Qf3':
      "And there's the modern Falkbeer challenge. Queen on f3, Black's knight on e4 with no defenders, Black forced to commit. The line goes deep from here — Black's main responses are 5...Nxc3 (the trade, leading to a balanced middlegame with doubled c-pawns for white), 5...f5 (sharp defense, weakens the king but holds the knight), or 5...Nc5 (passive retreat, white develops with tempo). All three are real and worth knowing, but the position TO know is THIS one — because the queen on f3 is what makes the gambit declined sharp instead of comfortable for Black. Now you know why most strong Black players don't decline the Vienna Gambit; they take with exf4 and grind out the resulting positions.",
    // Center fork trick line through to the typical middlegame.
    // Open position with bishop pair vs piece coordination — clean
    // educational moment.
    'e4 e5 Nc3 Nf6 Bc4 Nxe4 Nxe4 d5 Bxd5 Qxd5 d3 Nc6 Nf3 Bf5 O-O O-O-O d4':
      "Material is even — you traded the bishop for the pawn, then Black recovered the knight with the d5 fork. Black walked out with the bishop pair (a small long-term plus). We've now reached the typical center fork trick middlegame: opposite-side castled kings (white short, black long), Black's bishop pair vs White's piece coordination, the d4 break opening lines. Both sides have a clear plan. This is exactly why most Vienna players prefer 4.d3 instead of 4.Nf3 against the 2...Nc6 line — to avoid this whole sequence. Now you know the trap. Back up and try 3.Bc4 against 2...Nc6 instead, or play this position out against me?",
    // 2...Bc5 calm Italian-Vienna — symmetrical Italian structure
    // with the Vienna's Nc3 as the asymmetry. Reached when Black
    // mirrors with the bishop early and we develop normally.
    'e4 e5 Nc3 Bc5 Nf3 Nf6 Be2 Nc6 d3 d6 O-O O-O':
      "And there's the calm Italian-Vienna. Both kings castled, e4-pawn doubly defended (Nc3 + d3) so the center fork trick is dead. The asymmetry — what we have over a normal Italian — is the knight already on c3 ready for Nd5 or supporting d4. From here you have three real plans: Be3 to challenge the dark-bishop, Nd5 to plant a knight in the heart of Black's position, or h3 + g4 to start a slow kingside attack. All real, all winnable. Want to play it out?",
    // Italian-Vienna middlegame — both kings castled, doubled
    // e-pawns the cost of opening the f-file, dark-square bishop
    // gone on both sides. This is a position you should know cold:
    // the textbook Vienna setup with a clear plan.
    'e4 e5 Nc3 Nc6 Bc4 Nf6 d3 Bc5 Be3 Bxe3 fxe3 d6 Nf3 O-O O-O Bg4 h3':
      "And there it is — the Vienna middlegame in its purest form. Both kings castled, dark-square bishops traded off (which suits us — we have the open f-file as compensation for the doubled e-pawns), the c4-bishop still pointing at f7. From here Black has to decide whether to trade on f3 (giving us the queen on f3 hitting f7 and ready to swing) or retreat to h5 (and we play g4 to chase it further). Either way, our middlegame plan is set: double the rooks on the f-file, push d4 to break the center when ready, swing the queen to h5 or g3. This is the position to know cold. Want to play it out from here as a real game?",

This is the cleanest move at amateur level — and Stockfish actually agrees it's the best survival move for Black. Why? Every other knight move loses material to a queen capture along the open diagonal: Ng4 hangs to Qxg4, Nh5 hangs to Qxh5 (along d1-h5), Nd5 hangs to Nxd5 (our knight takes), Ne4 hangs to Nxe4. The d1-queen has a clear shot at the kingside now that the f-pawn is gone. So Black retreats with two tempi spent (Nf6 then Ng8) and we have a huge lead in development.
