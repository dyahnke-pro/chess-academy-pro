/**
 * sanitizeCoachText — strips LLM directive markup so the user never
 * sees or hears it.
 *
 * The legacy agent protocol asked the model to emit inline tags like
 * `[[ACTION:name {"json":"args"}]]` which the dispatcher parsed.
 * The new architecture uses structured `tool_calls` from the provider
 * API, but DeepSeek (and occasionally Anthropic) still pattern-match
 * to the inline-tag shape. Polly was reading those aloud verbatim.
 *
 * This module is the defense-in-depth filter:
 *   1. `sanitizeCoachText` — pure function, strips markup from a full
 *      string and collapses whitespace.
 *   2. `sanitizeCoachStream` — streaming-safe variant. Returns the
 *      portion safe to emit NOW plus any pending text that contains
 *      a half-arrived marker, which the caller buffers until the next
 *      chunk closes the marker.
 *
 * Markup shapes handled:
 *   - `[[DIRECTIVE:args]]` — double-bracket form (canonical)
 *   - `[DIRECTIVE:args]`   — single-bracket legacy form
 *
 * `DIRECTIVE` is one or more uppercase letters / digits / underscores,
 * starting with a letter. `args` can be any text including JSON with
 * nested braces (`{`, `}`); the regex is non-greedy on `]]` so the
 * first matching closer terminates the marker. Single closing
 * brackets `]` inside JSON args (e.g. `[1,2,3]`) are tolerated.
 */

/** Match `[[DIRECTIVE:...args...]]` non-greedy on `]]` so multiple
 *  markers in one string strip independently. `[\s\S]` matches
 *  newlines too — the LLM sometimes wraps long tool-args across
 *  lines. */

 *  trailing whitespace surviving). The full-string variant trims the
