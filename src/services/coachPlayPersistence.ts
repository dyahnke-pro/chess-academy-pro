/**
 * coachPlayPersistence
 * --------------------
 * Resumable coach-play state.
 *
 * When the student leaves the play tab mid-game (to solve a puzzle,
 * read a walkthrough, etc.) and later taps Play, the board should pop
 * up where they left off — same position, same opponent configuration.
 *
 * We persist a small snapshot of the active game to the Dexie `meta`
 * table (IndexedDB — survives reload, app close, PWA reinstall on
 * iOS). Only one active game per profile; starting a new one
 * overwrites the snapshot; game-end clears it.
 *
 * Kept intentionally small (no commentary history, no key moments)
 * so every move can write synchronously without lag. The FEN is the
 * truth; everything else is session configuration.
