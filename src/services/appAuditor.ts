/**
 * appAuditor
 * ----------
 * Unified rolling-window audit log for the whole app. Captures four
 * classes of issue:
 *
 *   1. Narration factual errors (piece-on-square, check/mate, etc.) —
 *      emitted by `narrationAuditor.recordAudit()`.
 *   2. Uncaught runtime errors — global `window.onerror` / unhandled
 *      promise rejections. Installed by `installGlobalErrorHooks()` on
 *      app boot.
 *   3. Subsystem failures — TTS cascades, bad FENs, LLM errors,
 *      Stockfish timeouts, Lichess failures, Dexie writes. Logged
 *      explicitly by the owning service at the failure point.
 *   4. App state anomalies — React error boundary catches, navigation
 *      failures, FEN desyncs.
 *
 * Every entry lands in the same Dexie `meta` key under a rolling
 * window (`APP_AUDIT_LOG_MAX_ENTRIES`). The debug panel (Settings →
 * About → Narration audit) reads the whole log and exports it as a
 * markdown report via "Copy for Claude".
 *
 * Contract: every writer must be fire-and-forget.
 *   void logAppAudit({ ... });
 * The logger swallows its own errors — a failing audit write must
 * never break the feature path that raised it.

  // Rolodex entry beat (WO-ROLODEX-PLUMBING-01 item 1). Fires once per

  // transition template instead of leaving the user with silence.
  | 'phase-narration-fallback-shown'
  // Opening-tour wiring (WO-COACH-TOUR-WIRING). One entry per quiz
  // lifecycle stage so a "the coach asked me to play Nf3 and then

  | 'quiz-started'
  | 'quiz-resolved'
  | 'quiz-cancelled'
  | 'walkthrough-started-from-coach'
  // WO-COACH-PERSONALITIES (PR B). Fires when the user picks a new
  // personality OR adjusts a dial in Settings — joined with the

  // coach sound different in this build?" report can be answered
  // by walking the timeline.
  | 'coach-personality-changed'
  // WO-COACH-OPPONENT-FX. Fires every time the coach commits a move on
  // the board. Confirms the coach-move FX path (sound + last-move
  // highlight) ran — joined with the absence/presence of a matching
  // voice/sound event in the next audit window to diagnose which leg
  // of the FX is missing if the user reports silence.
  | 'coach-move-fx-emitted'
  // WO-COACH-MATE-FLOOR. Fires when the coach's mate-floor safety
  // check vetoed the LLM's pick because it walked into a forced mate
  // (≤ 2 plies). Override is the engine bestmove. Counting these in
  // production tells us how often the LLM picks losing moves — a
  // high rate means the prompt or rating-tier calibration needs work.
  | 'coach-move-mate-floor-triggered'
  // WO-COACH-RATING-FLOOR. Fires when the coach's quality-floor safety
  // check vetoed the LLM's pick because the centipawn loss vs the
  // engine's bestmove exceeded the student's rating-tier threshold.
  // Counting these tells us whether the cp-loss thresholds are tuned
  // correctly per tier (too many at intermediate = floor too tight;
  // too few at master = floor too loose).
  | 'coach-move-quality-floor-triggered'
  // WO-COACH-PERSONALITY-VOICE. One entry per Polly speak() call with
  // the resolved voice + active personality + dial settings. Captures
  // the cross-product of voice × personality × dials in production so
  // we can see which combinations users actually run (and whether any
  // pairing produces empirically bad output we should warn about).
  // Joins with the existing `voice-speak-invoked` audit on timestamp
  // for the full picture.
  | 'coach-narration-spoken'
  // WO-COACH-FX-DIAG. Diagnostic checkpoints inside the coach-turn
  // flow so the next audit log can pinpoint exactly where the FX
  // path breaks. Joined with the existing coach-move-fx-emitted
  // audit: if a checkpoint fires "reached applyCoachMove" but no
  // coach-move-fx-emitted follows, the bug is inside applyCoachMove
  // itself; if a "cancelled-at" checkpoint fires before the FX, the
  // coach-turn cleanup is firing too aggressively. Temporary —
  // remove once the FX-missing root cause is fixed and verified.
  | 'coach-turn-checkpoint'
  // Per-move narration audit (WO-MOVE-NARRATION-REENABLE). Fires from
  // CoachGamePage (blunder + non-blunder branches), narrateMove() in
  // coachAgentRunner, and CoachPlaySessionView whenever a move-level
  // speak is dispatched — and from the gating branch that skipped it
  // (verbosity 'off' / empty commentary / narrationMode disabled).
  // Joined with voice-speak-invoked so a "I have commentary on but
  // hear nothing after my move" report has a complete causal chain.
  | 'coach-move-narration-fired'
  | 'coach-move-narration-skipped'
  // Opening auto-detection trail (WO-CONVERSATIONAL-OPENING-COACH).
  // Fires once per move from CoachGamePage when detectOpening() runs
  // against the SAN history. Captures: detected eco/name/plyCount,
  // resolution source (URL subject vs committed intent vs auto-detect
  // vs nothing), and the resulting `inOpeningTeaching` decision. Use
  // these to debug "why didn't the coach name my opening?" reports —
  // either the detection trie missed the line (opening-auto-detected
  // absent) or teaching mode didn't activate (opening-teaching-active
  // absent).
  | 'coach-opening-auto-detected'
  | 'coach-opening-teaching-active'
  // Find-the-Square drill (David's 2026-05-19 spec). Fires once per
  // round start with the target list — pair with downstream
  // findSquareAttempts rows in Dexie to reconstruct per-round timing.
  | 'find-square-round-start'
  // Diagnostic audits added to identify root causes for user-reported
  // bugs WITHOUT guessing the fix. Each one captures the inputs that
  // would otherwise require speculation. Once the audit log shows the
  // failure mode for each, the next PR can fix from evidence.
  // -----------------------------------------------------------------
  // Review playback step trail. Fires from useReviewPlayback.commitPly
  // every time the ply changes — captures from-ply, to-ply, nav source
  // (goForward / goBack / goToStart / goToEnd / jumpToPly), the SAN at
  // the destination, and whether speech was requested. Diagnoses
  // "review skips two pieces" reports: if `to - from > 1` from a
  // goForward call, the bug is concrete.
  | 'review-playback-step'
  // Engine-lines layout state. Fires from CoachGameReview when the
  // engine-lines panel is toggled — captures viewport orientation,
  // viewport width/height, board container width before/after the
  // toggle. Diagnoses "showing lines shrinks the board" reports by
  // making the dimension diff measurable instead of subjective.
  | 'engine-lines-layout-state'
  // Verbosity resolution trail. Fires inside coachMoveCommentary when
  // the LLM call is dispatched — captures what verbosity value was
  // received vs the user's profile preference. Diagnoses "Settings
  // verbosity dial doesn't work" reports by making the propagation
  // path visible (settings → preference → arg → LLM).
  | 'verbosity-resolved'
  // TTS overlap detection. Fires from voiceService.speakInternal when
  // a new speak() arrives while a previous utterance is still playing.
  // Captures the new utterance preview, the previous-tier (polly /
  // web-speech / voice-pack), and the caller source if available.
  // Diagnoses "two voices at once" reports — every overlap leaves a
  // record so we can see which surfaces are racing.
  | 'tts-concurrent-speak'
  // Tool-call error capture. Fires from coach/coachService.ask when a
  // tool invocation returns an error — captures tool name + full error
  // text + arguments. Diagnoses tool dispatch issues like the
  // "aiColor must be 'white' or 'black'" we saw on local_opening_book
  // by surfacing the exact arg that failed.
  | 'tool-call-error'
  // Move-commentary skip reasons. Fires from every early-return in
  // generateMoveCommentary so the previously-silent paths
  // (`offline`, `verbosity===none`, empty history, ⚠️ banner, LLM
  // exception, empty-after-trim) leave a record. Evidence-driven —
  // saves a debug round-trip the next time `coach-move-narration-skipped
  // reason=empty-commentary` shows up: the new audit names exactly
  // which path returned empty. Joins with the existing
  // `coach-move-narration-skipped` on timestamp + fen.
  | 'commentary-skipped'
  // LLM response trail (move commentary). Fires inside
  // coachMoveCommentary.getLlmCommentary right after
  // getCoachChatResponse returns. Captures length, preview, latency,
  // and the personality+dial values that were sent in the prompt.
  // Closes the observability gap between `verbosity-resolved` (LLM
  // dispatched) and `commentary-skipped` (we returned empty) — if
  // the LLM is returning short / generic / non-personality output
  // despite the dials being set, this audit shows it directly
  // instead of forcing inference from "voice was bland."
  | 'llm-response'
  // Personality dials reaching the move-commentary prompt
  // (WO-PERSONALITY-IN-COMMENTARY). Mirrors coach-narration-spoken at
  // the prompt-assembly side so we can confirm in production logs that
  // profanity=hard / mockery=hard actually flowed into the LLM call —
  // not just into the TTS layer.
  | 'coach-move-personality-applied'
  // WO-PLAN-B coach-move fast path. Fires when the coach-turn skips
  // the LLM spine entirely and uses opening book / Stockfish bestmove
  // directly. Replaces 8s of multi-trip LLM tool dance with ~250ms of
  // deterministic move selection. Spine still runs as fallback if the
  // fast path can't produce a legal move.
  | 'coach-move-fastpath'
  // Coach FX cancellation race — fires when the coach-turn effect was
  // aborted (game.fen changed, useEffect re-fired) AFTER chess.js was
  // already mutated. We commit the FX path anyway to keep
  // gameState.moves in sync with the chess instance and to ensure the
  // last-move highlight, sound, narration, and move-list entry land
  // on the coach's move.
  | 'coach-move-fx-cancellation-ignored'
  // WO-NARR-POLICY-01 — proactive tactic alert spoken after the coach
  // sets up a threat on the board. Stockfish-driven (no LLM round-trip),

  | 'coach-tactic-alert-spoken'
  // Phase 5 visual-signature audits. Captured so a "this UI feels broken"
  // report has a concrete trail of what the user saw.
  // ---
  // route-changed: fires on every URL change. Lets a session reconstruct

  // routed wrong, or a programmatic redirect?).
  | 'route-changed'
  // scroll-hint-state: fires when the gold-bar comet activates or
  // deactivates (overflow-detected, scroll-discovered, end-reached).
  // Diagnoses "the gold bar isn't moving" reports.
  | 'scroll-hint-state'
  // asset-load-error: fires when a piece sprite or other static asset
  // fails to load. Hooked into ConsistentChessboard's overlay path so
  // the Phase 1.3 bishop-sprite report has a Network-tab-like trail
  // even from a non-DevTools session.
  | 'asset-load-error'
  // /weaknesses (Game Insights) observability trail. The surface was
  // observability-blind before this audit — zero audit hooks meant
  // the audit stream couldn't see when the student refreshed the

  // ─── Tactics tab (TACTICS_SHOULD_WORK.md) ────────────────────────────
  // Mirrors the F1 fix from PR #504 (zero `logAppAudit` calls in
  // /weaknesses) — same disease applied across all 11 tactics
  // surfaces. The audit-stream live-watch couldn't see any tactics

  //
  // Tier 1 — confessed weakness signals.
  // `move-attempt`: emitted on EVERY move input across puzzle,
  //   walkthrough, endgame playout, and coach-play surfaces. Carries
  //   { surface, fen, attemptedSan, correctSan?, isCorrect,
  //     moveMethod: 'drag'|'click', timeFromPositionEnterMs,
  //     sourceId? (puzzleId/lessonId/gameId), tacticType?, phase? }.
  //   Drives moveAttemptsPerPuzzle, decision-reversal joins, hint
  //   effectiveness joins.
  | 'move-attempt'
  // `hint-revealed`: extended hint-system audit superseding the older
  //   `coach-memory-hint-{requested,recorded}` (kept for compat).
  //   Carries { source, surface, reason: 'student-tap'|'auto-reveal'|
  //   'coach-initiative', tier: 0|1|2|3, timeToRevealMs, fen,
  //   tacticType?, phase?, openingEco? }. Effectiveness joined at
  //   query time with the next move-attempt on the same FEN.
  | 'hint-revealed'
  // `position-dwell`: time spent on a position before leaving it
  //   (moved away, navigated, session-end). Cheap timer pattern —
  //   emit on exit, not entry. Carries { surface, fen, dwellMs,
  //   exitReason: 'moved'|'navigated'|'session-end' }.
  | 'position-dwell'
  // Tier 2 — high-volume engagement.
  // `engine-lines-dwell`: emitted when the engine-lines panel closes,
  //   with the duration it was open. Joins with the existing
  //   `review-engine-lines-toggled` for open-event metadata.
  | 'engine-lines-dwell'
  // `insights-tab-switched`: emitted on /weaknesses tab swap. The
  //   global `route-changed` audit doesn't see in-page tab state.
  | 'insights-tab-switched'
  // `endgame-playout-attempt`: emitted per attempt inside an endgame
  //   playout. Replaces the rollup-only `endgameProgress.totalWrongAttempts`
  //   with a per-attempt trail. Carries { lessonId, attemptedSan,
  //   isCorrect, attemptIndex, fen }.
  | 'endgame-playout-attempt'
  // Tier 3 — narration interaction.
  // `narration-replay`: student tapped replay on the last narration block.
  | 'narration-replay'
  // `narration-muted` / `narration-unmuted`: voice toggle audit.
  | 'narration-muted'
  | 'narration-unmuted'
  // Tier 4 — session shape.
  // `session-shape`: emitted on session end with surfaces visited +
  //   time per surface + dominant phase. Companion to db.sessions which
  //   is currently orphaned (write-only).
  | 'session-shape'
  // Tier 5 — second-pass additions (post-review).
  // `move-reversed`: drag-and-drop reversal — piece picked up, legal-move
  //   dots shown, piece returned without playing. The hesitation IS the
  //   signal. Carries { surface, fen, pickedUpSquare }.
  | 'move-reversed'
  // `puzzle-skipped`: skip button engaged. Different from wrong — an
  //   engagement weakness, not a skill weakness.
  | 'puzzle-skipped'
  // `repeat-mistake`: emitted when a previously-recorded mistake puzzle
  //   is attempted AGAIN and the student plays the SAME wrong move.
  //   Highest-signal weakness row — "you make the same mistake twice."
  | 'repeat-mistake'
  // `lesson-started` / `lesson-completed` / `lesson-abandoned`: per-
  //   walkthrough lifecycle. Abandon = exit before the final step.
  | 'lesson-started'
  | 'lesson-completed'
  | 'lesson-abandoned'
  // `coach-question-topic`: best-effort topic classification on
  //   `coach-brain-ask-received`. Captures what the student asks about
  //   — their questions reveal their gaps better than their moves.
  | 'coach-question-topic'
  // `srs-session-{start,complete}`: opening trainer review-session
  //   trail. Lets us see in the audit stream when David opens the
  //   trainer and how many cards he's clearing per session — useful
  //   signal for tuning the daily cap and the per-card budget.
  | 'srs-session-start'
  | 'srs-session-complete'
  // `analytics-self-audit`: emitted by the in-app AnalyticsAuditPanel
