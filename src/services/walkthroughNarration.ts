// Pure helpers for picking the right narration text (and auxiliary fields)
// for a walkthrough step.
//
// The data model supports embedded narration fields on OpeningMoveAnnotation:
//   - `narration`        — the canonical voice script for this move
//   - `shortNarration`   — a trimmed version for higher speed tiers
//   - `coachHint`        — a short coaching tip for drill mode / hint button
//
// Old annotations (no narration field) keep working: we derive a spoken
// script from `annotation` using the same sentence-trim rule that
// WalkthroughMode used before this refactor.
//
// Callers should ALWAYS go through these helpers rather than reading
// annotation fields directly, so the fallback chain stays centralized.

import type { OpeningMoveAnnotation } from '../types';

/**
 * Patterns used by the offline annotation generator when it couldn't
 * produce real commentary. These are baked into thousands of move
 * entries across the opening annotation JSON files (albin, alekhine,
 * benoni, birds, catalan, etc.) and produce noise like:
 *   "Bg2 by White. The position is heading toward the critical moment."
 *   "d6 by Black. The position is becoming uncomfortable — careful defense is needed."
 *   "Nf6 brings the knight into the game. Development with purpose — the knight on f6 eyes important squares."
 *   "Black plays e6, developing normally. The opponent may not see what's coming."
 * Treat matches as "no annotation" so both the AnnotationCard and the
 * voice service stay silent rather than reading filler.
 *
 * Each pattern targets a distinctive templated phrase — not just any
 * sentence containing a chess term — so real curated annotations that
 * happen to mention "development" or "pawn structure" are preserved.
