/**
 * Tactic Alert Service — the brain of the across-app coaching system.
 *
 * Two modes:
 * 1. GAMEPLAY: Detect tactic opportunities during coach games / opening free play.
 *    Alert timing adapts to player rating — weaker players get told sooner.
 *    After a move that misses a tactic, coach speaks up so the player can take back.
 *
 * 2. TRAINING: Detect when a player is struggling during tactical puzzles.
 *    Deliver tactic-specific conceptual coaching that teaches the pattern,
 *    not just "try again." Adapts to rating and weakness profile.
