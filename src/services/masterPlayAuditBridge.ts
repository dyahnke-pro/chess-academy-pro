/**
 * masterPlayAuditBridge
 * ---------------------
 * Production-safe bridge that exposes the master-play services on
 * `window.__masterPlayAudit` ONLY when the audit-stream is configured.
 * Lets `scripts/audit-coach-master-integration.mjs` drive the
 * deployed app via `page.evaluate` without needing the source-file
 * paths Vite serves in dev mode (production bundles those away).
 *
 * The bridge is a side-effect import — pulling this module is enough
 * to install the bridge at boot. It's a no-op when localStorage's
 * `auditStreamUrl` is unset, which is the default for every real
 * user. The audit script sets that key via `addInitScript` before
 * page load, so the bridge activates only during audit runs.
 *
 * Why this isn't a leak:
 *   - The bridge is gated on `auditStreamUrl` being set, which the
 *     migration in `appAuditor.loadAuditStreamConfig` clears from
 *     localStorage after copying to Dexie. So even if the value
 *     somehow ends up in a real user's localStorage, the bridge
 *     window is one boot wide; subsequent boots see the cleared
 *     key.
 *   - The exposed surface is read-only (functions), not state.
 *     Nothing here grants extra capabilities beyond what the
 *     services already expose.
 *   - The kid model lane was deleted 2026-10-08, so there is no kid
 *     path to expose here.
