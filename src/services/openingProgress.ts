/**
 * openingProgress
 * ---------------
 * Tracks which post-walkthrough stages the student has completed for
 * each opening. Stored as a single JSON blob in Dexie's `meta` table
 * (no schema bump needed — the meta table is generic key/value).
 *
 * Stages tracked:
 *   - 'walkthrough' — completed when student reaches any leaf
 *   - 'concepts'   — completed when all concept questions answered
 *   - 'findMove'   — completed when all find-the-move puzzles answered
 *   - 'drill'      — completed when at least one drill line played clean
 *   - 'punish'     — completed when all punish lessons answered
 *
 * The stage menu renders a checkmark next to each completed stage so
 * the student can see what they've already done. Per the user's
 * morning iteration: "I want an indicator on the different levels
 * identifying completion."
