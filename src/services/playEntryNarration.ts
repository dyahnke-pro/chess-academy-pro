/**
 * playEntryNarration
 * ------------------
 * Templates for the one-line coach beat that fires on `/coach/play` mount
 * when the user arrived via a rolodex-style deep link (URL carries
 * `?opening=<name>`) — i.e. the student tapped a card that says
 * "practice the Italian Game" and landed in a game.
 *
 * Without this beat the cold-load experience is indistinguishable from
 * a generic `/coach/play` — board at starting position, "vs Stockfish
 * Bot" header, no felt cue the coach knows the chosen opening. The beat
 * is the rolodex's signature ("I see what you tapped").
 *
 * Rules (CLAUDE.md "Narration Voice Rules"):
 *   • Names the pattern (rule 7) + side + a directive.
 *   • No first-person, no meta-coaching (rule 6).
 *   • No "let's", "I'll", "we will".
 *   • No UI references (rule 2).
 *   • No acknowledgments (rule 5) — "good pick" / "great choice" banned.
 *   • Short — under 12 words (rule 10).
 *
 * Why 4 variants? Three is borderline (returning users could hear the
 * same beat back-to-back); five is bloat. Four gives enough rotation
 * across a typical rolodex (Italian / Caro-Kann / Sicilian / Vienna /
 * Queen's Gambit / Ruy Lopez / English / French ...) that any two
 * favorited openings reliably land on different directives.
 *
 * Variant selection: deterministic-by-opening (hash of name → index).
 * Same opening always picks the same directive — that's a feature, not
 * a bug. Across DIFFERENT openings the user gets variation; revisiting
 * the SAME opening gives the same line, reinforcing "this is YOUR
 * Italian Game".
