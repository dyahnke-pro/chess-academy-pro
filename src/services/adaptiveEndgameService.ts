/**
 * adaptiveEndgameService
 * ----------------------
 * Adaptive difficulty for endgame puzzles. Reuses the same
 * convention as the puzzle-trainer tab (adaptivePuzzleService +
 * puzzleService.calculateRatingDelta) but pulls puzzles from the
 * endgame theme pool (puzzles.json filtered by Lichess endgame
 * theme tags) and persists to its own `UserProfile.endgameRating`
 * field — kept separate from the general tactic rating so endgame
 * solves don't shift the puzzleRating shown in the tactics tab.
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *   - Session rating starts at `UserProfile.endgameRating ?? 1200`.
 *   - Each correct attempt: sessionRating += STEP_CORRECT.
 *   - Each wrong attempt: sessionRating -= STEP_WRONG (with extra
 *     penalty per consecutive miss).
 *   - Next puzzle picked from the closest unplayed entry in the
 *     lesson's practiceThemes pool within `±BAND_WIDTH` of session
 *     rating. Band widens progressively when none match.
 *   - Persistent user endgameRating updated via classic Elo
 *     (K=32) against the just-played puzzle's rating.
 *
 * The session adjustment drives the NEXT puzzle's difficulty
 * target; the Elo update is what the Stats page will display as
 * the player's endgame puzzle strength.
