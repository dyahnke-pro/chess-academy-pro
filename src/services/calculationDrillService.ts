/**
 * calculationDrillService
 * -----------------------
 * Filters the local Lichess puzzle DB (`puzzles.json`, 15K curated)
 * by theme tags for the six calculation skill drills:
 *   1. Find the Mate (mateIn2/3/4/5)
 *   2. Quiet Move (winning move isn't a check/capture)
 *   3. Forcing Sequence (long-calculation puzzles)
 *   4. Defensive Calc (find the only defense)
 *   5. Race Calculation (pawn races + promotion)
 *   6. Tactical Pattern (sacrifice / attraction / deflection)
 *
 * Same architectural contract as everywhere else — moves come from
 * the puzzle DB, the runtime LLM is voice-only. Each drill returns
 * up to N puzzles sorted by rating ascending so the difficulty
 * ladder opens easy and ramps up.
 *
 * Per-skill puzzle counts confirmed at build time via the test
 * suite — every skill must have ≥50 puzzles to be useful.

      "Mate is the cleanest calculation training ground: every move is forced, every variation ends in mate or doesn't. Start at mate-in-2 (4 plies of calculation), graduate to 3, 4, and 5. Each rank up the ladder doubles the calculation tree — the same skill, more depth.",

    description: "The winning move isn't a check or a capture. Look harder.",
    rationale:
      "Most amateurs only consider checks and captures when calculating. Quiet-move puzzles break that habit — the right move is positional, sometimes a retreat, sometimes a king move that creates a multi-move threat. Drill these and you'll start seeing winning moves your opponent doesn't.",

    id: 'forcing-sequence',
    name: 'Forcing Sequence',
    description: 'Long forced lines — calculate four plies in a row without losing the thread.',
    rationale:
      "Calculation depth is a stamina muscle. These puzzles require seeing 4-8 plies of forced play to find the win — every move forces a single response, and you need to track the tree without flinching. Lichess tags these as 'long' precisely because they reward the calculator who doesn't quit at move 3.",

  {
    id: 'defensive-calc',
    name: 'Defensive Calc',
    description: 'Find the only move that holds. Defense is calculation under pressure.',
    rationale:
      "Defensive puzzles are easier to play once you find the move — but harder to find. Every other candidate loses immediately; only one move works. Drill these to build the precision needed in lost-on-paper positions where one half-step saves the game.",
    themes: ['defensiveMove'],

  {
    id: 'race-calculation',
    name: 'Race Calculation',
    description: 'Pawn races and promotions — count tempi, decide who wins.',
    rationale:
      "When both sides race pawns to promote, the position is decided by exact tempo math: who promotes first, who promotes with check, who can stop the other. These puzzles drill the counting muscle directly, with the answer always concrete (the pawn either queens or it doesn't).",

  {
    id: 'tactical-pattern',
    name: 'Tactical Pattern',
    description: 'Recognize the motif (sacrifice / attraction / deflection), then calculate the line.',
    rationale:
      "Tactics aren't pure calculation — they're pattern recognition followed by calculation. A sacrifice is a calculated investment; an attraction lures the king; a deflection breaks a defender. Drill the named patterns and your calculation gets a head start: you know what shape you're calculating before you start counting.",

      "The lazy-perfect choice. No theme filter — every puzzle is pulled from the full endgame pool at your current rating. Get a streak going and the puzzles get harder; miss one and they ease back. Every fifth puzzle is biased toward your weakest theme so the gaps in your toolkit don't get ignored. Use this when you don't want to pick a specific skill — just let the algorithm drive.",
