/**
 * stockfish-ios-fix.spec.ts
 *
 * Validates the audit-fix that moves the iOS Safari detection to the
 * FIRST check inside stockfishEngine.tryStart() — before the
 * `forceSingle` and sticky `_runtimeFallbackAttempted` branches.
 *
 * The bug (build 7eca7c3): the sticky-fallback path bypassed iOS
 * detection, routing iOS Safari users to STOCKFISH_ST_URL (the
 * lite-single bundle), which crashes ~5×/sec on iOS with
 * `RuntimeError: call_indirect to a signature that does not match`.
 * Live audit captured 120 such errors in 15 min on /coach/endgame.
 *
 * The fix: iOS detection short-circuits to LILA_BRIDGE_URL
 * unconditionally, regardless of forceSingle or sticky-fallback
 * state.
 *
 * This spec spoofs an iPhone Safari user-agent + maxTouchPoints,
 * pre-seeds the `sfx.multi-fallback-attempted.v1` localStorage flag
 * (the trigger of the sticky-fallback path), then navigates to a
 * route that requires Stockfish. Pass criteria:
 *   1. ZERO `call_indirect` console errors in 15 s
 *   2. The audit-log entry `stockfish-variant-resolved` reports
 *      `variant=lila` (not single, not multi)
